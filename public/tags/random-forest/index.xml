      <description>Introduction In this project we are going to use the dataset Car Features and MSRP, which can be found on Kaggle. As the name suggests the dataset contains features about different car models, along with a variable called MSRP, short for manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price.
We are going to make some exploratory data analysis, EDA, and we are going to try to predict the prices of the different car models using machine learning methods.</description>
