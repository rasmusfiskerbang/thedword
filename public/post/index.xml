      <description>Introduction In this post I am going to explore some chess data. The data is obtained from a free online chess database. In addition, I have scraped chess openings from FICGS and matched them to the first moves from each game from the chess DB.
Originally the chess DB contained about 3.5 million games, which took up about 2.5 GB. After I removed missing values, incomplete columns etc., I now have about 860000 games, which is much more manageable.</description>

We are going to make some exploratory data analysis, EDA, and we are going to try to predict the prices of the different car models using machine learning methods.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this project we are going to explore the infamous bicycling race Tour De France! First we will take look at the dataset, and then we are going to try to answer some of the following questions.
 What is the most winning country? Who is the most winning rider? How many different type of stages do we have, and how frequent are they? Who are the kings of the different types of stage?</description>
